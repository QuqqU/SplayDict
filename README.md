SplayDict written in Swift, is a collection type like special ordered [set](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set?changes=_2). 
It's based on [Splay tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree) which reflects tendency of search input data.

<a id="why"></a>
## What is SplayDict?
SplayDict is Dictionary using splay tree, not red-black tree.
Due to attribution of splay tree, it is very fast to get data searched frequently.

In real world, so many search are requested. And many people requset a same(or similar) data. Every request, every new search. It's very consumptively. 

Using SplayDict, it's not waste of time. It takes a very short time to get data searched frequently. (But, It takes a little more time to find data searched occasionally.) 
According to [Pareto's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), using SplayDict makes a program be productive, and even faster.

<a id="Usage"></a>
## Usage

- declaration
```swift
var a: SplayDict<Int, Double> = SplayDict() // make a empty splay set.
var b = SplayDict([1, 3, 2]) // make a set which contains 1, 2, 3.

// and more constructor is building...
```

- insert
```swift
var a: SplayDict<Int, Int> = SplayDict()
a.insert(key: 3, value: 7)
// Insert [3 : 7] into SplayDict.
a[5] = 12
// Insert [5 : 12] into SplayDict.

// If you want to insert key which is already exists,
// then being value is replaced with newValue.
```

- top
```swift
_ = a.top 
// Return a top element of SplayDict.
// It's a latest searched data.
// Read-only property
```

- find
```swift
var a: SplayDict<Int, String> = SplayDict()
let value: String? = a.find(key: 7) 
// Return value if search value exists, else return nil.
// And this make searched key(or nearest key) be on a top of SplayDict.
```

- delete
```swift
a.delete(key: 5)
// Delete element corresponded with key in SplayDict.
// Make a biggest key under input be a top element.
```

- indexOf
```swift
var a: SplayDict<Int, Double> = SplayDict()
let value: Double? = a.indexOf(3)
// Return n-th value if SplayDict.
// If index is out of range, returns nil.
```

- reverse
```swift
a.reverse(from: 3, to: 6)
// Reverse elements. (from 3 to 6)
// Implement using Lazy Propagtion.

// example
// Let splay set consists of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
// reverse(from: 3, to : 6).
// The result is [0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3].
```
